  - *Priority collections to implement:*
    - **users**: Long-term memory, preferences, server contexts
    - **conversation_logs**: Testing data, performance metrics
    - **image_cache**: Hash-based image description storage  
    - **tool_cache**: Cached tool call responses with TTL
    - **server_settings**: Blacklists, configurations, preferences

- [ ] **Update message buffer system in messageCreate.js** - Refactor from object-based to array/improved object structure **[HIGH FEASIBILITY]**
  - *Current issue: Uses object with message IDs as keys, requires Object.keys() iteration*
  - *Proposed: Array-based system or Map structure for better performance*
  - *Benefits: Cleaner code, better performance, easier message ordering*
  - *Implementation: Replace messageBuffer[userId].messages object with array*
  - *Assistant task: Can be automated/assisted for implementation*
  
- [ ] **Rework codebase away from OpenAI** - Migrate from OpenAI dependencies to alternative solutions **[HIGH FEASIBILITY]**
  - *Target: Full migration to Ollama/local models*
  - *Components: Replace openai library calls, update configuration*
  - *Testing: Parallel testing during migration, feature parity validation*
  - *Fallback: Graceful degradation if local models unavailable*
  - *Cost analysis: Performance vs. cost trade-offs*
  
- [ ] **Remove redundant code** - Clean up duplicate and unnecessary code sections **[HIGH FEASIBILITY]**
  - *Tools: ESLint, code analysis tools, manual review*
  - *Focus areas: Duplicate functions, unused imports, dead code*
  - *Refactoring: Extract common utilities, consolidate similar logic*
  - *Testing: Maintain test coverage during cleanup*
  
- [ ] **Remove redundant features** - Identify and eliminate unused or overlapping functionality **[HIGH FEASIBILITY]**
  - *Audit: Feature usage analytics, user feedback analysis*
  - *Candidates: Unused commands, overlapping functionality, deprecated features*
  - *Migration: Graceful deprecation, user notification*
  - *Documentation: Update help text, remove references*

## Technical Considerations
- **System Requirements**: Monitor RAM/CPU usage with multiple models
- **Model Management**: Automatic model loading/unloading based on demand
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement intelligent caching for frequently used operations
- **Scalability**: Design for horizontal scaling, load balancing
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging, metrics collection, alerting
- **Security**: Input validation, rate limiting, secure model hosting
- **Backup**: Regular data backups, disaster recovery planning

- [ ] **Implement Discord markdown parsing** - Parse Discord-specific formatting elements for better conversation understanding **[HIGH FEASIBILITY]**
  - *Discord emoji parsing:*
    - **Custom emojis**: Parse `<:name:id>` and `<a:name:id>` (animated) format
    - **Standard emojis**: Unicode emoji detection and conversion to readable text
    - **Emoji context**: Replace parsed emojis with descriptive text for LLM understanding
    - **Reaction context**: Understand emoji reactions in conversation context
    - **Server-specific emojis**: Handle custom server emojis Barry may not have access to
  - *User and role mentions:*
    - **User mentions**: Parse `<@!userid>` and `<@userid>` to actual usernames
    - **Role mentions**: Parse `<@&roleid>` to role names for context
    - **Everyone mentions**: Handle `@everyone` and `@here` appropriately
    - **Mention context**: Understand when Barry is mentioned vs. when others are mentioned
    - **Nickname resolution**: Use Discord API to resolve mentions to display names
  - *Channel references:*
    - **Channel mentions**: Parse `<#channelid>` to channel names
    - **Cross-server channels**: Handle mentions from other servers gracefully
    - **Channel context**: Understand conversation references to other channels
  - *Discord formatting:*
    - **Text formatting**: Parse `**bold**`, `*italic*`, `__underline__`, `~~strikethrough~~`
    - **Code formatting**: Handle inline \`code\` and ```code blocks```
    - **Spoiler tags**: Parse `||spoiler text||` and handle appropriately
    - **Quote blocks**: Process `> quoted text` for conversation context
  - *Message links and references:*
    - **Message links**: Parse Discord message link format
    - **Cross-server links**: Handle links from other servers
    - **Reply context**: Understand message replies and threading
  - *Implementation approach:*
    - **Pre-processing pipeline**: Clean Discord markdown before sending to LLM
    - **Context preservation**: Convert formatting to natural language descriptions
    - **Fallback handling**: Graceful degradation for unresolvable mentions/emojis
    - **Caching**: Cache resolved mentions and emoji descriptions
    - **API integration**: Use Discord.js methods for mention/emoji resolution
  - *Processing examples:*
    - **Input**: `Hey <@123456> check out <#general> for <:poggers:789> content`
    - **Processed**: `Hey @username check out #general for poggers emoji content`
    - **Input**: `**This is important** and ||spoiler text|| here`
    - **Processed**: `BOLD: This is important and SPOILER: spoiler text here`
  - *Performance optimizations:*
    - **Batch resolution**: Resolve multiple mentions/emojis in single API calls
    - **Local caching**: Store resolved mentions and emoji data
    - **Smart parsing**: Only parse when Discord-specific elements detected
    - **Async processing**: Non-blocking resolution with fallbacks
